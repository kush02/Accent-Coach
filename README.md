# Accent-Coach

The aim of Accent Coach is to train people to speak in an accent of their choice. To achieve this, we need a 1) accent classification component to recognize the current accent and 2) a voice/accent conversion module.

Most computational functions are written. Some data-handling functions need to be added and the parameters of the classifiers need to be fine-tuned.

Documentation needs to be added.
